![Splash Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfultz/20GamesChallengePong/main/assets/splash.png)


This is my first attempt at making a game on my own. I made all of the sprites by hand and coded it all the same. Hopefully it will work as expected.


## Tools Used
* [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)

Player One 

- W = Up

- Up Arrow = Up
- Down Arrow = Down
