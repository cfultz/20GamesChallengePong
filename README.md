# 20 Games Challenge: Pong

[!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfultz/20GamesChallengePong/main/assets/splash.png)


This is my first attempt at making a game on my own. I made all of the sprites by hand and coded it all the same. Hopefully it will work as expected.


## Tools Used
* [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)
* [Aseprite (Steam Version)](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite)

## Controls

This is a two player game that can be played on keyboard and mouse or a single Controller (made with the Steam Deck in mind). 

```bash
Player One 

- W = Up
- S = Down
- Left Joystick Up/Down


Player Two

- Up Arrow = Up
- Down Arrow = Down
- Right Joystick Up/Down
```
